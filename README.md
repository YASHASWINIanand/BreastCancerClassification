# Breast Cancer Classification

## Abstract
Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer among women worldwide. In this study, we aim to compare the performance of four widely-used machine learning algorithms – k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests – for the classification of breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Our methodology involves preprocessing the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, standardizing the features, and training each classifier on the training data. We evaluate the performance of each algorithm based on key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings indicate that Logistic Regression emerges as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of 97.37%, precision of 97.22%, recall of 98.59%, and F1-score of 97.90%. Random Forest also performs well with an accuracy of 96.49%, precision of 95.89%, recall of 98.59%, and F1-score of 97.22%. These results suggest that Logistic Regression and Random Forests are promising algorithms for breast cancer classification, with potential implications for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, further research is warranted to validate these findings on larger datasets and explore additional optimization strategies.

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify breast cancer using various machine learning algorithms. The algorithms compared in this study are:

- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forests

## Dataset
The dataset used for this study is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Methodology
1. **Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
2. **Standardization**: Features are standardized to improve model performance.
3. **Training**: Each classifier is trained on the training data.
4. **Evaluation**: Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- **Logistic Regression**: 
  - Accuracy: 97.37%
  - Precision: 97.22%
  - Recall: 98.59%
  - F1-score: 97.90%
- **Random Forest**: 
  - Accuracy: 96.49%
  - Precision: 95.89%
  - Recall: 98.59%
  - F1-score: 97.22%

## Conclusion
Logistic Regression and Random Forests show promising results for breast cancer classification. Further research is needed to validate these findings on larger datasets and explore additional optimization strategies.
